This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the component renders every item in the dataset, causing performance issues and potentially crashes.  The problem arises because the `renderItem` function is called for each item, regardless of whether it's visible on the screen. This leads to unnecessary rendering and memory consumption.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View>
      <Text>{item.text}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
/>
```
